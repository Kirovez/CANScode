## Repository containing code for our recent paper  (link will be here lately):
**Illuminating the transposon insertion landscape in plants by Cas9-targeted Nanopore sequencing and novel pipeline**

We applied a recently published method of Cas9-targeted Nanopore Sequencing (CANS, [Gilpatrick et al., Nature Biotechnolgy, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0407-5))

# NanoCasTE
NanoCasTE is a new pipeline for detection of Transposable Element Insertions (TEIs) using Nanopore reads obtaining after CANS reads sequencing.
